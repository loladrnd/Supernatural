# **Sam Winchester**

By comparison to his older, more aggressive brother, Sam is often the exasperated voice of reason. He does not see monsters in black and white like Dean. He operates on an innocent until proven guilty basis. However, don't let that big brain and kind eyes fool you into thinking he is nothing more than a bookworm.
